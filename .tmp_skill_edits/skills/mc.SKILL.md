# MultiClaude (mc)

Dispatch Claude agent workers in isolated git worktrees to do real work in parallel. Each worker gets a full repo copy, commits to its own branch, and creates a PR via `gh`.

## Repo Registry

MultiClaude can dispatch workers to any registered repo, not just the current one.

**Registry file**: `~/.claude/mc-repos.json`

Format:
```json
{
  "repos": {
    "conclave": "/Users/whit/work/conclave",
    "prime": "/Users/whit/work/claude-prime",
    "speckit": "/Users/whit/work/speckit"
  }
}
```

- The current working directory is always available as `@here` (no registration needed)
- Registered repos are referenced with `@name` syntax: `/mc work @prime "fix the auth bug"`
- If no `@repo` is specified, defaults to the current working directory

## Subcommands

### `mc work "<task>"` (aliases: `w`, bare string)

Dispatch a single worker agent to handle a task.

1. **Resolve target repo**:
   - Parse `@repo` prefix from the task string if present
   - If `@repo` specified: read `~/.claude/mc-repos.json`, resolve to absolute path
   - If no `@repo`: use current working directory
   - Read the target repo's CLAUDE.md for conventions

2. **Understand context** before dispatching:
   - Read any files the user references or that are obviously relevant
   - Check git status and current branch of the target repo
   - Identify conventions, test commands, project structure

3. **Launch one Agent** with these settings:
   - `isolation: "worktree"` — worker gets its own repo copy
   - `run_in_background: true` — don't block the coordinator
   - `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`

4. **Worker prompt must be self-contained.** Include:
   - The task description (verbatim from user)
   - Target repo path (the worker must `cd` there if it's not the current repo)
   - Relevant codebase conventions discovered in step 2
   - File paths and context the worker will need
   - The message drop location (see Messaging below)
   - The worker protocol (see Worker Protocol below)

5. **Report** the agent ID and task summary. Track it for `/mc status`.

**Examples:**
- `/mc work "add input validation to the signup form"`
- `/mc work @prime "update the prompt template for v2"`
- `/mc "fix the flaky timeout in test_auth.py"` (bare string = work)

### `mc swarm "<goal>"` (aliases: `s`, `fan`)

Fan out multiple parallel workers for a larger goal. This is the power move.

1. **Resolve target repo(s)**:
   - Parse `@repo` prefix if present (applies to all workers unless overridden per-unit)
   - Cross-repo swarms are supported: individual units can target different repos

2. **Research phase** (foreground, not background):
   - Read relevant files, understand the codebase area
   - Decompose the goal into 2-10 independent work units
   - Each unit must be independently mergeable (no cross-dependencies between workers)
   - Identify shared conventions, test commands, and patterns

3. **Present the decomposition** to the user:
   ```
   Swarm plan for: "<goal>"

   | # | Worker | Repo | Files/Scope | Description |
   |---|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
   | 1 | ... | @here | ... | ... |
   | 2 | ... | @prime | ... | ... |
   ```
   Ask: "Launch N workers?" (proceed on confirmation, or accept edits)

4. **Launch all workers in a single message** (parallel Agent calls):
   - Every agent gets `isolation: "worktree"` and `run_in_background: true`
   - Every prompt is fully self-contained with conventions + worker protocol + message drop
   - All launched simultaneously — do NOT launch sequentially

5. **Render the tracking table:**
   ```
   | # | Worker | Repo | Status | PR |
   |---|--------|------|--------|----|
   | 1 | title  | @here | running | -- |
   | 2 | title  | @prime | running | -- |
   ```

6. **As workers complete**, update the table. When all done, render final summary.

**Examples:**
- `/mc swarm "add unit tests for all service classes"`
- `/mc swarm @prime "migrate all API endpoints from v1 to v2 format"`
- `/mc fan "update every Dockerfile to use multi-stage builds"`

### `mc status` (aliases: `st`, `ls`)

Show current state of all dispatched workers.

- Check all tracked agent IDs via TaskOutput with `block: false`
- Render table: #, worker title, repo, status (running/done/failed), PR link, duration
- Parse `PR: <url>` from completed agent output
- Check `~/.claude/mc-messages/` for any unread worker messages (see Messaging)
- If a worker failed, show a brief error summary

### `mc gather` (aliases: `g`, `collect`)

Wait for all running workers to complete, then show final results.

- Use TaskOutput with `block: true` for each running agent
- Render the final table with all PR links
- Show any worker messages collected during the run
- Summarize: "N/M workers landed PRs"
- List any failures with brief error context

### `mc msg "<agent-id>" "<message>"` (aliases: `m`, `tell`)

Send a message to a running or completed worker. The coordinator writes guidance that the worker picks up.

1. Write the message to `~/.claude/mc-messages/<agent-id>/from-coordinator.md` (append, timestamped)
2. If the worker is **completed**: resume it with `resume: "<agent-id>"` and include the message in the resumed prompt
3. If the worker is **running**: write the file — the worker protocol instructs workers to check for messages periodically. The message will be picked up on the worker's next check cycle.

**Examples:**
- `/mc msg abc123 "also update the README when you're done"`
- `/mc tell abc123 "skip the migration tests, they're flaky"`

### `mc repo` (aliases: `repos`, `r`)

Manage the repo registry.

- **`mc repo list`** — show all registered repos
- **`mc repo add <name> <path>`** — register a repo: `/mc repo add prime ~/work/claude-prime`
- **`mc repo rm <name>`** — unregister a repo
- **`mc repo scan`** — auto-discover git repos in common locations (`~/work/`, `~/projects/`, `~/src/`) and offer to register them

Registry is stored at `~/.claude/mc-repos.json`. Create the file on first `repo add` if it doesn't exist.

## Messaging Protocol

Workers and the coordinator communicate via the filesystem at `~/.claude/mc-messages/<agent-id>/`.

### Coordinator -> Worker
- File: `~/.claude/mc-messages/<agent-id>/from-coordinator.md`
- Coordinator appends timestamped messages
- Workers check this file before each major step (if it exists)

### Worker -> Coordinator
- File: `~/.claude/mc-messages/<agent-id>/from-worker.md`
- Workers write here when they hit a blocker, need a decision, or want to flag something
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <type>: <message>` where type is `BLOCKED`, `QUESTION`, `INFO`, or `DONE`
- `/mc status` reads these files and surfaces messages

### Message Types (worker -> coordinator)
- **BLOCKED**: Worker can't proceed without input. Coordinator should `/mc msg` a response or `/mc resume` the worker.
- **QUESTION**: Non-blocking question. Worker continues with best guess but flags for review.
- **INFO**: Status update. "Tests passing", "Found 3 more files that need changes", etc.
- **DONE**: Final message before worker exits. Includes PR link.

## Worker Protocol

Every worker prompt MUST end with this instruction block (copy verbatim):

```
## Message Drop
Your message directory is: ~/.claude/mc-messages/{AGENT_ID}/
- Check for ~/.claude/mc-messages/{AGENT_ID}/from-coordinator.md before each major step. If it exists and has new content, follow any instructions there.
- If you hit a blocker or need to flag something, write to ~/.claude/mc-messages/{AGENT_ID}/from-worker.md using the format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] TYPE: message (TYPE is BLOCKED, QUESTION, INFO, or DONE)

## Completion Protocol
After you finish implementing the change:
1. Run the project's test suite if one exists (look for package.json scripts, Makefile targets, pytest, go test, etc.). If tests fail, fix them.
2. Commit all changes with a clear, descriptive message.
3. Push the branch and create a PR with `gh pr create --fill`. If `gh` is not available or push fails, note it in your final message.
4. Write a DONE message to your message drop: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] DONE: <summary>. Include the PR URL.
5. End your response with a single line: `PR: <url>` so the coordinator can track it. If no PR was created, end with `PR: none — <reason>`.
```

**Important**: Replace `{AGENT_ID}` in the template with the actual agent ID when constructing the prompt. You won't know it until launch, so create the message directory after launching (use Bash `mkdir -p`) and note the mapping.

## Behavior Notes

- **Bare string = work.** If the user writes `/mc "do something"` without a subcommand, treat as `work`.
- **Keep it terse.** This is a dispatch tool, not a conversation. Confirm launch, show table, report results.
- **No file overlap between swarm workers.** If two workers would touch the same file, merge them into one unit or sequence them with a note.
- **Conventions travel with the worker.** Always read CLAUDE.md and relevant config before dispatching. Workers can't ask you questions mid-run — they must be self-sufficient. Messaging is for course corrections, not Q&A.
- **Don't duplicate work.** The coordinator researches once, then workers execute. Don't re-research in each worker prompt.
- **PR title format.** Workers should use descriptive PR titles, not generic ones. Include the scope: "Add validation to signup form" not "Fix stuff".
- **Cross-repo workers don't get worktree isolation.** The `isolation: "worktree"` flag only works for the current repo. For `@other-repo` workers, the prompt must instruct the worker to `cd` to the repo path and create its own branch. Include explicit `git checkout -b <branch>` instructions in the prompt.
- **Message directory lifecycle.** Create `~/.claude/mc-messages/<agent-id>/` when launching. Clean up completed worker directories on `/mc gather` (or leave them — they're small).
